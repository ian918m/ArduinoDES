ArduinoDES
==========

DES, TripleDES, NonupleDES encryption/decryption library for the Arduino microcontroller platform.
-- now with SeptenvigupleDES support!   -- yes, that means '27'
cloned from 'Octoate' orignal DES & 3DES:  https://github.com/Octoate/ArduinoDES
His code was ported from the AVR-Crypto-Lib (http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/AVR-Crypto-Lib).

To install the library, download and copy the files into a subfolder (e.g. "DES") in the 
"libraries" folder of your Arduino development environment.

The library was tested on a:   ...


Usage
=====

It is possible to encrypt and decrypt messages with the DES, 3DES, 9DES & 27DES crypto algorithms.
Have a look at the example code for more information.
